# 🧠 Reverse Engineering Practice Repository — English Version

## 🎯 Project Title

**Crackme Solutions & Analyses (Educational Purpose)**

## Overview

This repository contains *educational* analyses, write-ups, and reimplemented code for crackme challenges solved for learning and personal development. **I do not claim ownership of any original challenge binaries.** Only safe, educational materials created by me are included.

---

## 📚 Contents

- Detailed reverse engineering analyses (assembly walkthroughs, offsets, logic flow)
- Decompiled or reimplemented source code (no copyrighted binaries)
- Safe proof-of-concept examples
- Turkish translation: `README.tr.md`

---

## 🚫 Excluded Content

- No original challenge binaries (.exe, .dll)
- No cracked or redistributed proprietary software
- No malware or unsafe code

> **Note:** Original binaries must always be obtained from official and verifiable sources.

---

## 🌐 External Download Sources

To ensure safety and legal compliance, **no executables are stored in this repository.** You can download challenges directly from trusted sources:

- [Crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one/) — Main educational source for these exercises.

> ⚠️ Always verify downloaded files and test only in isolated environments.

---

## 🔒 Security Practices

- Use an **isolated virtual machine (VM)** or sandbox.
- Keep the network disabled during testing.
- Never run unknown binaries on your host OS.
- Report issues using GitHub Issues tagged `security`.

## 📁 Repository Layout Example

```
/challenge-name/
  ├─ analysis.md        # Notes and logic
  ├─ solution/          # Safe, reimplemented logic
  ├─ tests/             # Minimal test cases
  └─ artifacts/         # Screenshots or disassembly snippets
```

---

## 🧩 Safe Workflow

1. Read `analysis.md`.
2. Run `solution/` in a controlled environment.
3. If needed, execute binaries only in an offline VM snapshot.
